Use MySQL –( Joins and Subqueries)
Create Customer and Account table and add rows shown below

1. Show the cname, Acc_Type, amount information of customer who is having an saving account.
2. Display the data using Natural, left and right join.
3. Display the information of customers living in the same city as of ‘pooja’.
4. Display the information of account, having less amount than average amount throughout the bank.
5. Display the C_id having maximum amount in account.
6. Display the amount and acc_type of those customers whose amount is the minimum amount of that Acc_type.
7. Display the amount of those accounts whose amount is higher than amount of any saving account amount.

#To perform these tasks in MySQL using joins and subqueries, you can follow the steps below. First, let's create the Customer and Account tables and add the rows as you mentioned:

CREATE TABLE Customer (
    C_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Cname VARCHAR(255),
    City VARCHAR(255)
);

CREATE TABLE Account (
    Acc_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    C_id INT,
    Acc_Type VARCHAR(255),
    Amount DECIMAL(10, 2),
    FOREIGN KEY (C_id) REFERENCES Customer(C_id)
);

INSERT INTO Customer (C_id, Cname, City) VALUES
    (1, 'John', 'New York'),
    (2, 'Pooja', 'New York'),
    (3, 'Alice', 'Los Angeles'),
    (4, 'Bob', 'New York');

INSERT INTO Account (Acc_id, C_id, Acc_Type, Amount) VALUES
    (101, 1, 'Savings', 5000.00),
    (102, 2, 'Savings', 6000.00),
    (103, 3, 'Checking', 3000.00),
    (104, 4, 'Savings', 7500.00);

#1 Show the cname, Acc_Type, amount information of customers who have a savings account
SELECT C.Cname, A.Acc_Type, A.Amount
FROM Customer C
INNER JOIN Account A ON C.C_id = A.C_id
WHERE A.Acc_Type = 'Savings';

#2 Display the data using Natural, left, and right join.
-- Natural Join
SELECT C.Cname, A.Acc_Type, A.Amount
FROM Customer C
NATURAL JOIN Account A;

-- Left Join
SELECT C.Cname, A.Acc_Type, A.Amount
FROM Customer C
LEFT JOIN Account A ON C.C_id = A.C_id;

-- Right Join
SELECT C.Cname, A.Acc_Type, A.Amount
FROM Customer C
RIGHT JOIN Account A ON C.C_id = A.C_id;

#3 Display the information of customers living in the same city as 'Pooja'.
SELECT C.Cname, C.City
FROM Customer C
WHERE C.City = (SELECT City FROM Customer WHERE Cname = 'Pooja');

#4 Display the information of accounts with an amount less than the average amount throughout the bank.
SELECT A.Acc_id, A.Acc_Type, A.Amount
FROM Account A
WHERE A.Amount < (SELECT AVG(Amount) FROM Account);

#5 Display the C_id having the maximum amount in the account.
SELECT C_id
FROM Account
WHERE Amount = (SELECT MAX(Amount) FROM Account);

#6 Display the amount and Acc_Type of those customers whose amount is the minimum amount of that Acc_Type.
SELECT C.Cname, A.Amount, A.Acc_Type
FROM Customer C
INNER JOIN Account A ON C.C_id = A.C_id
WHERE (A.Amount, A.Acc_Type) IN (
    SELECT MIN(Amount), Acc_Type
    FROM Account
    GROUP BY Acc_Type
);

#7 Display the amount of those accounts whose amount is higher than the amount of any savings account.
SELECT Acc_id, Acc_Type, Amount
FROM Account
WHERE Amount > (SELECT MAX(Amount) FROM Account WHERE Acc_Type = 'Savings');
