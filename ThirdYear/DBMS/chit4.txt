VALUES (1, 'John', 'Computer', 120);

INSERT INTO student (S_ID, name, dept_name, tot_cred)
VALUES (2, 'Alice', 'Math', 90);

-- Create the instructor table
CREATE TABLE instructor (
    T_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,

#1 Find the average salary of instructors in departments where the average salary is more than Rs. 42,000:
SELECT dept_name, AVG(salary) as avg_salary
FROM instructor
GROUP BY dept_name
HAVING AVG(salary) > 42000;

#2 Increase the salary of each instructor in the computer department by 10%:
UPDATE instructor
SET salary = salary * 1.10
WHERE dept_name = 'Computer';

#3 Find the names of instructors whose names are neither 'Amol' nor 'Amit':
 SELECT name
FROM instructor
WHERE name NOT IN ('Amol', 'Amit');

#4  Find the names of students whose names contain 'am' as a substring:
SELECT name
FROM student
WHERE name LIKE '%am%';

#5 Find the names of students from the computer department who take "DBMS" courses:
SELECT s.name
FROM student s
JOIN course c ON s.dept_name = c.dept_name
WHERE c.title = 'DBMS' AND s.dept_name = 'Computer';
